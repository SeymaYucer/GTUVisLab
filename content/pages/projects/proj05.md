<p>The aim of this project is to develop a novel real-time surveillance video summarization system that 
employs the eye-gaze positions of the surveillance operator. The system output can 
be used to efficiently view the overlooked sections of the surveillance video, which 
can be used to increase the reliability of the surveillance system. The summary of the 
operator-monitored actions can also be obtained for efficient reexamination of the 
surveillance videos. The system employs a novel non-linear video abstraction method 
that can mix actions from different frames into the same summary frame for more 
compact videos. The video summaries are done in real time on average hardware 
thanks to the improved dynamic programming based techniques. We performed 
several experiments using synthetic and real world surveillance videos, which showed 
the practical applicability of our system.</p>
