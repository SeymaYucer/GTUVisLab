Noninvasive content viewing systems have found many applications in today's world including 
medical imaging, industrial inspection, military applications, and package scanning for security 
applications. X-ray based scanning systems are the most common due to their relatively low cost and 
high transportability.  

<p>

X-ray based package scanners are most useful for the security of the public places such as airports and 
shopping malls. Therefore, there is a very large Research and Development (RD) community on this 
area. In addition, the market that exploits the technology produced by this RD is very large and grows 
at a very fast rate. Although the domestic market is large and still grows substantially for Turkey, the 
RD work on this area is not at the desired levels. In fact, there are almost no X-ray based scanners 
developed in Turkey. This situation results in a very big dependency on the imported goods and 
services for Turkey.

<p>

One of the main motivations for the proposed project is the design and development of a prototype x- 
ray based package scanning system including the hardware and software components. At first, the x- 
ray source and the sensors will be imported from abroad but later they will also be replaced by 
comparable devices developed by the partner firm. The project partner firm has experience on the 
production of x-rays sources and we plan to capitalize on their knowledge. The software part of the 
scanner device will be completely developed at the partner institutions and hence we expect the final 
scanner device to cost much less than the imported scanner devices. This low cost will bring 
significant market advantage for the partner firm when it first introduces the devices.

The other motivation for the proposed project is academic oriented. The x-ray based scanners have 
been employed since 1920s. Although the fundamental technology is based on propagating the x ray 
through the materials, there have been numerous improvements on this field such as Computer 
Tomography (CT). CT is a very attractive technology because it can give precise information about 
the volume elements of materials. However, the still high costs of CT devices and their relatively 
large physical sizes make them impractical for many applications. There are alternative methods such 
as stereoscopic x-ray imaging which is not as expensive as the CT technology. The literature includes 
methods that use stereo x-ray scans to feed the direct image to the operator for a feeling of depth. 
However, this feeling cannot be converted to solid 3D data. With the proposed project, we plan to 
bring new methods from the computer vision area and apply them to solve object depth problems after 
some development. The degree of precision and the reliability of the 3D data will be available during 
the project.
